## Usage

To use a program, first navigate to its root folder, e.g. `cd '.\01 - Additive Cipher\'`.

There, each program has its own `README.md`, in which the command line syntax is listed and an execution example is given.

Arguments enclosed in `<>` are required arguments, while arguments in `[]` are only required in some cases. Each argument has a data type.

All input files must be located in the `res/` folder, while the output files are created in the `out/` folder.
