# 3. Operating Modes

This program implements the various operating modes for block ciphers. The only functionality in this chapter is to test the implementation of such modes. A very simple encryption and decryption is used for testing.

To test each mode, a text is encrypted and then decrypted. If the text obtained matches the source text, the implementation of the mode is correct.

## Execution

The output of the test program is displayed on the console.

### Test Modes

```shell
python test_modes.py
```
